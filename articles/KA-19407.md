# Launch Sync not working

## Description

You may experience the following error:<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___92bfb324-2bce-ec11-a7b5-0022480a8e40___.png)

## Resolution


This issue will always be resolved when you will sign out and Sign in again, as Launch expects some parameters which may not be present sometime due to browser-specific issues
