# Campaign Standard - Special characters not displaying properly in transactional emails

## Description


Transactional email templates have utf-8 character settings.

 Despite this, special characters are not displaying properly when the field is dynamic.

If any static text is there with special characters, it displays as expected.


## Resolution


This can happen because the encoding must be specified in the Content-type header of the API call made to trigger the transactional event:

*Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8*
