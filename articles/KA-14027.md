# Use of $ in values while setting up a [!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder] rule

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

There are use cases when the revenue needs to be populated as the [!UICONTROL Classification] value. It requires the usage of currency symbols, for example, $ for USD.



Usage of USD $2500 - $3000 for regex as the [!UICONTROL Classification] value in a rule in the [!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder] will return an error. This is because the $ symbol denotes the end of the key in Regular Expressions.


## Resolution


Space can be used to escape $. For instance, a space between $ and the number will resolve the issue.

Example: USD $ 2500 - $ 3000
