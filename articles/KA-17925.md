# What is the "Number" that is displayed when viewing the results of an Adobe Target recommendation in Adobe Analytics?

## Description

I want to report the results of recommendations in Adobe Analytics. At this time I use the dimension "Target Experience" or something similar and when I look at the results I see "3 different numbers" (e.g. xxx-xxx-xxx). What does this mean?

## Resolution


This is the IDs you used in the Adobe Target recommendation. From left to right, it means "Algorithm ID - Template ID (Design) - Experience ID".
