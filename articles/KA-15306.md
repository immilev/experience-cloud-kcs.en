# ACS: Random characters appear in column definitions on file upload

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 When a file is uploaded on the [!UICONTROL Load file] activity, when you refresh to detect a new column, extra characters appear with the "Email" header.
 This can also be seen in Column Definition.
 The ID will result with an i_Email instead of Email.

<u>Steps to reproduce the issue</u>:

1. Use a workflow--[!UICONTROL Load file] activity.
Have a CSV file with at least one column with a header, let's say: "Email."
2. Select the file within the [!UICONTROL Load file] activity to import the file.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL File structure] tab after a successful import.

When you refresh to detect a new column, you will see extra characters with the "Email" header.
This can also be seen in [!UICONTROL Column definition].

Extra characters appear with the "Email" header.
 This can also be seen in Column Definition.
 The ID will result with an "i_Email" instead of "Email".

## Resolution


<b>Cause</b>
The issue is related to the file encoding.

When files are saved with the UTF-8-BOM encoding, the BOM characters (EF BB BF) are added at the beginning of the file.
