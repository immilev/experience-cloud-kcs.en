# Activity not tracking qualifying visitors

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
XT Activity using Geo audiences has been showing zero visitors in the Activity since the past two weeks when it was made live. When testing Activity from the activity URL, I am qualifying for the Activity and getting counted in the reports.



But other visitors are not getting counted in the Activity. As per [!DNL Analytics], the page had 100 visitors on the Activity page.

## Resolution


This may be happening if:

- URL isn't normally available for normal visitors when browsing the site.
- The activity URL might not be the same as the webpage. For example, Activity is created on https://abc.com. However, when navigating through the website, it takes you to https://www.abc.com.


In the above scenarios, the actual website visitors would not be able to qualify for the Activity and hence would not be tracked in [!DNL Target] Activity reports but may still be available in [!DNL Analytics].
