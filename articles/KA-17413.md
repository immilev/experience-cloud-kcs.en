# Precautions for modifying global mbox of an account

## Description

Will modifying the global mbox of an account mess with existing experiments or anything else? Is this safe to do and if so, what precautions should be taken?

## Resolution


A few points to note are:

1. Changing the global mbox will only change the mbox of future activities. It will have no effect on already existing activities.

2. The only problem that might arise is if the same website is being targeted for both new and old activities. The at.js on the site would need to be updated for the new activities to show up.

3. A copy of the activity could be made and modified rather than changing the mbox on the fly. Metrics such as conversions are counted based on what mbox was seen so changing this could make some reports confusing.
