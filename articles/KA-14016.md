# Target Recommendations visual composer workflow error

## Description


Recommendations Activities created using the Visual composer does not sync. Error consistent across multiple users.

Steps to Reproduce:
                 1) Create recommendations activity and select visual composer
                 2) Proceed through set up, we clicked a page element and used "replace with recommendations"
                 3) Use the criteria and designs
                 4) Set any traffic allocation
                 5) Save Activity
                 Notice: Does not sync.
 Note: Form based composer recommendations work flow works fine.


## Resolution


A setting needs to be enabled on Target Classic-Client Details page to support "Visual recommendation offer"

After this setting is enabled, we should be able to sync the Recommendations VEC activties successfully.
