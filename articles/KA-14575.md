# Campaign Standard: Intermittent 400 failures for "KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics" workflow

## Description


It has been reported an issue with the  technical workflow "KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics" is intermittently hitting the 400 error below:

API call to Adobe Analytics failed - Url: [https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=Report.Get](https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=Report.Get "Follow link") Request body : {"reportID":2033917055} Response: 400 Error: {"error":"report_not_ready","error_description":"Report not ready","error_uri":null}


## Resolution


After verification with Analytics support, the warning message is expected sporadically. Basically, the message means the Analytics report is still processing, inferring that the Campaign should try later. It is possible that occasionally the report takes a long time to run or the data is latent.
