# 400 errors for "[!UICONTROL KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics]" workflow

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 The technical workflow <b>KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics</b> intermittently hits the 400 error similar to the error below:

```
API call to Adobe Analytics failed - Url: https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=Report.Get Request body : {"reportID":2033917055} Response: 400 Error: {"error":"report_not_ready","error_description":"Report not ready","error_uri":null}
```

## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
After verification with [!DNL Analytics] support, the warning message is expected sporadically.

Basically, the message means the [!DNL Analytics] report is still processing, inferring that the [!DNL Campaign] should try later.

It is possible that occasionally the report takes a long time to run, or the data is latent.
