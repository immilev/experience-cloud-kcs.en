# Why link tracking call is skipped by the page URL related Marketing Channel processing rule

## Description

 
<br>Problem:
<br>Suppose you have a Marketing Channel processing rule like below, it should fall into the 'Email' channel if a page URL has 'mid' Query String Parameter.
<br>However, in some cases, a page URL with 'mid' query parameter like below 1 may be ignored by the 'Email' channel and fall into another one.
<br>

## Resolution




Resolution:

Check if the server call type is [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) such as Custom link instead of page view.  If it is a link tracking call, it is Working As Designed.



Root Cause:

Adobe data collection servers strip the pageURL dimension from all [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) image requests. 1  As such, the page URL matching rule won't work with link tracking calls.
