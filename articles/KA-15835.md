# [ACS] User group to hide reports

## Description


My customer has a requirement where they want to hide the all reports for some users from the UI.

 Is this achievable in ACS? I checked the documentation and could not find any way to accomplish that.


## Resolution


for a Standard User, it’s all or nothing. Hence this sort of cherry picking is not possible on the ACS instance for a standard user.
