# ACS - Schema deletion integrity rules (behavior if deleted) are not applied by workflow update data activities

## Description


In case you wonder about the schema integrity rules. Let's say the following integrity rule is defined on the source schema:



When a record is deleted on the target schema, all records from the source schema are deleted. So the integrity rule is respected. However, when a document is deleted on the target schema by using a workflow update data activity, the records from the source schema are NOT deleted. So the integrity rule is ignored.


## Resolution


Deleting a record manually through APIs or UI applies the link integrity rules defined in the custom resource definition. But from a workflow, this is bulk SQL instructions that are performed, so the workflow doesn't use the unitary link integrity rules. The workflow will have to be modified to handle the deletion of linked records. The same behavior is found in ACC.

Please note that the schema integrity rules are implemented at the UI level and NOT at the database level.
