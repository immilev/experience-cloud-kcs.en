<b>Link Clicks (ctx.ly)</b> = The total number of clicks on a URL embedded in the Post (Reported by ctx.ly - Adobe Social's native URL shortener). It can differ from what social platforms report due to ctx.ly reporting all clicks on the URLs, not just clicks from the Post, and the ctx.ly numbers are updated in real time.
