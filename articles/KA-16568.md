## Description

<b>Objective</b>

<b>Environment</b>

    <b>For example:</b>
    <b>dispatcher1</b>
    General = Enabled
    Transport = http://10.43.32.126/dispatcher/invalidate.cache
    Triggers = Check these boxes: Ignore Default, No Status Update, No Versioning
    
    <b>dispatcher2</b>
    General = Enabled
    Transport = http://10.43.32.146/dispatcher/invalidate.cache
    Triggers = Check these boxes: Ignore Default, No Status Update, No Versioning
3. Configure Dispatcher Flush UI to delete everything in the cache under /etc in the cache folder.  Refer to the [documentation](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/dispatcher-flush-ui/index.html).
