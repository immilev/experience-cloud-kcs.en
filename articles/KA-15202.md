# Cannot create [!UICONTROL Recipients]

## Description

## Resolution




Once we added the Recipient folder by right-clicking on the folder form <b>[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]</b>, things started to work again.


<b>Cause</b>
This error occurs when the default folder Recipients is made view instead of making a separate view folder for it.
