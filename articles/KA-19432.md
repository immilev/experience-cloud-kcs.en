# Missing tracking information : Message Centre Template

## Description

There can be a case when you publish a template (from your Marketing instance to the message center), and after sending out emails, you do not see the tracking information (only for the deliveries of that particular template)

## Resolution


Resolution - Please always check the "tracking and Images" section in the Delivery, two points which will be important here:

1.  The "Activate Tracking" & "Opens Tracking" must be ticked

2.  Check the "Images" tab in the "tracking and images" section in the delivery template, there should not be any error with respect to the images hosting
