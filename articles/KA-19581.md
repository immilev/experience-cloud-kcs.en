# Deleting Smart Tags for Multiple Assets

## Description

<u><b>Question:</b></u><br><br> <br><br>Is it possible to select numerous assets and delete their smart tags in Adobe Experience Manager, just as you can select many assets and bulk tag them?

## Resolution


<u><b>Answer:</b></u>

At the moment there is no capability that allows deleting smart tags in bulk.

Smart tags can be bulk managed only at the folder level:

Select the folder - Manage Tags and here you can add or remove tags by navigating the assets in the folder one by one.

Bulk smart tags deletion is suggested to the engineering team to be implemented in future releases.

More info about Smart Tags for Images can be found in 1.
