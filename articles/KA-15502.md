# Adobe Campaign Standard: Last Modified By listed as Anonymous

## Description


It has been noted that under many circumstances in ACS, the Last Modified By field shows up as Anonymous(Nobody) without any way to determine how the record got updated.

This is a limitation in the way that Campaign currently identifies records previously updated by deleted users, anonymous API requests, workflows, etc.


## Resolution


Currently an enhancement (CAMP-42665) has been created to expand on the details of the last modified by field.
