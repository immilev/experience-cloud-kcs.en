# Products for Recommendations in Target is not reflecting in UI.

## Description


Couldn’t find the product information in the Target UI under the Recommendations - Catalog Search

 Steps to Reproduce:
 We are trying to pass the product or content information to Recommendations using the entity attributes via the mbox by referring from the link ([https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/recommendations/plan-implement.html](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/recommendations/plan-implement.html "Click to follow link: https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/recommendations/plan-implement.html")) here.


 We can see the entity attribute values are getting populated on the AEM page, but Couldn’t find the product information in the Target UI under the Recommendations - Catalog Search


## Resolution


There is setting for sending the entity details through mbox which was not enabled for Client. We have now enabled it, but attributes should get into DB first, then in several hours they should be indexed and available in UI.

This setting is enabled form Recommendations Classic which is not accessible to the users, so the setting can be changed by clientcare only.
