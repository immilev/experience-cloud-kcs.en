## Description


Use case is to display the products from the same category, which visitor is currently accessing



Criteria Definition used is : Most Viewed Item as Recommendations Key , with Content similarity type


## Resolution

You should be using Content Similarity with the 'current Item' as recommendation criteria in place of Most Viewed key
