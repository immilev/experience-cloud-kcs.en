# Cleanup workflow fails/does not work and is missing logs

## Description


While investigating an issue with the cleanup log, there may be situations where the logs are incomplete:

-The workflow completes but old records are still not purged

-The workflow completes but lines of some steps seem to be missing

-The activity in the workflow flashes red

In all these cases the error message causing the issue is not present in the journal log.


## Resolution


Check the runwf/wfserver logs when the workflow is ran to identify the error message of the root cause.

In some installations (especially on-premise) these logs may not appear in the workflow log itself, due to app server architecture or other factors.
