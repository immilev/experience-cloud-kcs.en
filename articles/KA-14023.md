# Adobe I/O for [!DNL Target] - what is maximum number of requests per second?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

Target



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

An organization is using Adobe I/O [!DNL Target] APIs to retrieve change logs and performance data of activities for their markets.

After many successful requests, their requests begin to fail with an HTTP 503 error of *Service Unavailable*. They succeed when they retry these failed requests after a few minutes. The customer is using [https://mc.adobe.io/${requestData.tenant}/target/activities/${requestData.type}/${requestData.activityId}/report/performance?reportInterval=${requestData.startDate}/${requestData.endDate}](https://mc.adobe.io/$%7brequestData.tenant%7d/target/activities/$%7brequestData.type%7d/$%7brequestData.activityId%7d/report/performance?reportInterval=$%7brequestData.startDate%7d/$%7brequestData.endDate%7d) to retrieve performance data. They found that the API seems to fail after 50 requests. If the customer waits for 30 sec to 1 min, then most of the next set of requests will be successful.



What is the maximum number of requests per second the customer should make?
<br><br> <br>

## Resolution


The maximum number of requests per second that the customer can make is 50/min.

This is a general throttling per user.
