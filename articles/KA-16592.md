internal-notes: Also hacky, but if you don't mind parsing through a json file for the data, the UI makes a request to get that daily data when you load the trend report above you could grab. If you monitor the network calls it should be one with the file name of performance.at.json.

# Activity Reporting - Get Conversion and Impression Data by Date

## Description


While reviewing the results of a recent A/B test. I've selected the date range, changed the reporting methodology to visits, and exported the resulting data to CSV.

1. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a <b>method to download the reports data by date</b>. Is this not possible with Adobe Target?





## Resolution


We used to have a daily csv report in Target Classic interface, which is not available any longer.



Daily reporting is quite easy to do with Adobe Analytics now but for Adobe Target reporting, here are the current options:

1. Use the trend view of the reports. Switch to Daily and then Unique Visitors or Conversions as shown here . It isn't a perfect solution, but can get you some level of daily detail ![9-15-2020 5-57-14 PM.png](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/26856iB79D1F7E2EB217FD/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400)
2. A bit hacky, but you could use the performance API ([http://developers.adobetarget.com/api/#get-ab-performance-report](http://developers.adobetarget.com/api/#get-ab-performance-report)). You can add a reportInterval parameter to specify a specific range. This can allow you to make a request for each day and thereby allow you to collect the daily report numbers. Something like this API call should work once you have your authorization:

```
