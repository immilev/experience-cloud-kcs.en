# Classifications API Import Error Relation 0 is not currently set up to import data

## Description


What is the reason for the API import error "Relation 0 is not currently set up to import data" in Classifications (SAINT) API?


## Resolution


The error "Relation 0 is not currently set up to import data" is seen when the variable "product" is used with the upper case "Product". Classifications API will only accept the variable with 'p' in the lower case as "product".
