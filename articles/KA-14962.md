# Campaign Classic: Error : INT-150012 The HTTP query returned a 'Request Entity Too Large' type error (413)

## Description


It has been reported that the error bellow occurs when trying to upload data files greater than 50 MB in ACC via workflows



Error message:

INT-150012 The HTTP query returned a 'Request Entity Too Large' type error (413)


## Resolution


The reason for this is that in ACC 17.4.1 build 8797, a content length limit was introduced for Apache and IIS. This limit is set to 50MB by default and con be modified from the initial value of 52428800. The configuration file containing this value is the httpd.conf

Exmaple within Apache:


```
httpd.conf
...
  CampaignLimitRequest "52428800"
...
```
