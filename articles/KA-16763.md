# Create trait to capture all values in a variable c_evar1

## Description

<br><br><br>How to create a trait to capture all incoming values in AAM?<br><br><br>

## Resolution


This is achievable with the help of "Regular Expressions".

A condition such as "(c_evar1 matchesregex "\*.\*$")" would make a trait to capture all the values coming into AAM. This will act as "if c_evar1 exists".
