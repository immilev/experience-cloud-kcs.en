Problem Resolution =

As per our discussion with Engineering Team, It seems we do not support "time" data type in Adobe Campaign Classic.

You can refer to sfdcConnector.js for checking for datatypes that Adobe Campaign Classic supports.

It's available in Administration - Configuration - JS Codes

Our Engineering Team has recommended to use 'datetime'.
