# Adobe IO projects not available in Admin Console

## Description


A project created via Adobe I/O is not showing up in Admin Console.


## Resolution


There are 2 types of authentications that Adobe IO console provides:
<br><br>1. *OAuth Integration:*
- It doesn't need to be linked to a product profile because users have to login with their Adobe ID to access API via this authorization.
- So what kind of API, elements, metrics etc. can a user access is totally based on user profile.

<br><br>2. *Service Based Integration:*
- This is particularly used by team or users like Dev team.

    
- Its authentication is done via public-private key.

    
- Its needs to be linked to a product profile. Why? because users don't login to access API. They're to use a private key to to get the access token.
- So how would decide the API access level where user is not logging in via his Adobe ID - that's where product profile come into picture.

    Whatever access is there in the profile, the same applies to the API.
