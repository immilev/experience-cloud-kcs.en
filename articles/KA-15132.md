# gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address error while encrypting/decrypting using PGP keys

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- [!DNL Campaign]
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Getting the following error when using the encrypt post-process command or the decrypt pre-process command.


```
gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address
```





## Resolution


To fix the error mentioned above, you need to bypass the step where the system tries to output to `/dev/tty`, which either does not exists in the file system or the neolane user does not have rights to this directory. In the GPG command, add `--no-tty` to skip this step. E.g.:


```
etl
    preProcessCommand command="gpg --decrypt <b>--no-tty</b> --recipient \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* &quot;$fileName&quot;" label="Decryption GPG" name="GPGdecrypt"/
    postProcessCommand command="gpg --encrypt <b>--no-tty</b> --recipient \*\*\*\*\*\*\* &quot;$fileName&quot;" label="Encryption GPG" name="GPGencrypt" suffix="gpg"/
/etl
```

<b>Cause</b>
This error happens because the system tries to output to `/dev/tty`, which either does not exists in the file system, or the neolane user does not have rights to this directory.

Also, check if the passphrase in `preProcessCommand` is present or not. If the passphrase is missing, then also we can get this error.


```
etl
        preProcessCommand name="GPGdecrypt" label ="Decryption GPG" command="gpg --decrypt --passphrase passphrase --recipient CampaignOperations@adobe.com &quot;$fileName&quot;"/
        postProcessCommand name="GPGencrypt" label ="Encryption GPG" command="gpg --encrypt --recipient comp_ops@xxx.com.au &quot;$fileName&quot;" suffix="gpg"/
/etl
```
