# PDF Generation with personalization blocks fails

## Description


When attempting to create a dynamic PDF attachment that includes personalization blocks the workflow and delivery fail.

Documentation reference: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/generating-personalized-pdf-documents.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/generating-personalized-pdf-documents.html?lang=en)


## Resolution


The personalization block missed the "<b>href=</b>" keyword from the image link. Please see below:

Before:
<b>draw:image xlink:"https://www.xxxxx.net/xx-xxxxx/uploads/2022/05/XXXXX-logo-648.jpg" /</b>

After:
<b>draw:image xlink:href="https://www.xxxxx.net/xx-xxxxx/uploads/2022/05/XXXXX-logo-648.jpg" /</b>

Also, when creating the "docx" or "odt" template, do not write the code directly in the template file but instead use a text editor (like notepad) to create the code and copy back the code in the template file. Doing so will ensure accurate quotes and double quotes are used.
