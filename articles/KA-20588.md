# ERR_FAILUREMCPNSAPI 412 Precondition Failed - While sending Push messages_Test

## Description


Issue : Push deliveries in ACS starts to fail with error <b>ERR_FAILUREMCPNSAPI 412    Precondition Failed </b>

![](assets/___0cbe6fd2-a135-ed11-9db1-00224808679b___.png)



Resolution :

The iOS certificate is expired which throws this error in the delivery logs.

The certificate for iOS channel impacts also the android deliveries because the way the certificate is saved in MCPNS and ACS.

One App id is created in ACS which holds information about iOS and android.

The same app ID is propagated to MCPNS and single App ID is present for both channels.

Hence the expiration of the certificate in iOS leads to failure of both channels



Enhancements are already raised for :

1. Updating the error message

2. Warn about certificate expiry in the UI.
