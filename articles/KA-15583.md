# Override referrer variable with blank value

## Description


Redirects point the browser to a new location without user interaction ([https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/technotes/redirects.html](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/technotes/redirects.html))

 When the redirection occurs, the browser clears the referring URL and assigns the originating URL as the referrer. How can we clear the referrer value to get the right attribution?


## Resolution


To assign a blank value in the referrer variable, place the below piece of code within the *doPlugins*section:

s.referrer='';
 s.Ia=1; //This is an 'eye' and not an 'ell'
  
 Here's a doc on the doPlugins: [https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/doplugins.html](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/doplugins.html "Click to follow link: https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/doplugins.html").
