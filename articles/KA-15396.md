# Adobe Campaign Standard: Does Campaign use the new Litmus API?

## Description


It has been reported in ACS that the Litmus preview renders slowly.  It was found that ACS has been using the old preview API which is not as efficient as the latest API.


## Resolution


Currently there is an enhancement in place (CAMP-41340) for the updated Litmus API to be used in a future release.
