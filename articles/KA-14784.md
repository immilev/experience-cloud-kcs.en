# Campaign Standard: How to implement page anchors

## Description


A request has been submitted to implement an internal link type to create page anchors also called "jumping links".


## Resolution


Anchors can be implemented by using the HTML content component from the Email Designer.

Please consider the following example:

You can add the following HTML to the first HTML content component:
`a href="#C4"Jump to chapter 4/a`

And the second HTML content component will have:
`a name="C4"Chapter 4/a`

Lastly, the following line has to be commented out:
`meta class="nl-dce-fragment" data-nl-name="EmailUrlBase"`

Please note that this code line manages the relative URL so if you remove it, all your URLs will need to be absolute.
