# "AH01620: Could not open password file" messages in the logs after configuring Basic Auth in the AEMaaCS dispatcher

## Description


You configured Basic Auth in your AEMaaCS Dispatcher, added a .htpasswd file in the /conf.d folder.

But, you observe the message "AH01620: Could not open password file: /etc/httpd/conf.d/.htpasswd" in the logs.
<br><br>authn_file:error pid 241:tid 140454739073848 (2)No such file or directory: client 000.00.00.000:0 AH01620: Could not open password file: /etc/httpd/conf.d/.htpasswd<br>

## Resolution


Rename the .htpasswd file into e.g. htpasswd?

The files starting with a "." are considered hidden and removed while preprocessing the dispatcher configuration.
