Why Content Starts is greater than Media Starts in some scenarios?


## Resolution


This behavior can be caused by one of the following situations:

- There are no context data on Media Starts call sent from the player, To fix it the s.trackVars should contain all media context data parameters or just remove s.trackVars (that's for SDK version lower than 3.0);
- Mobile SDK or App Measurement is sending hits with timestamp value-added, while the report suite is set to non-timestamp data. To fix this, enable the report suite for timestamp optional hits;
- The player runs in a browser that discards tracking calls to our generic endpoints \*.sc.omtrdc.net. To fix this, use first-party domains like metrics.example.com
