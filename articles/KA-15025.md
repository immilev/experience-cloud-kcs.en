# Value showing up in post_evar in Data Feed not populating in reports

## Description


On analyzing post processed column of an evar in Data Feeds, the values populate. However, the same values don't show up in reporting in Adobe Analytics. Why?


## Resolution


If the evar is a merchandising evar with Product Variable syntax, the value of evar in post_product string will always take precedence over its value in post_evar column in the Data Feed. Consequently if the evar isn't populated as part of product syntax, the value in post_evar will be replaced with a null value.

This is why the values don't show up in reporting in Adobe Analytics.
