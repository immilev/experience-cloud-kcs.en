# Package installation issue on AEMaaCS

## Description


When trying to install a package on an AEM as a Cloud instance, the customer receives the error:

"Package (or its subpackage(s)) contains application content which isn't supported at runtime."



The package can be successfully installed on an On-Premise instance or on a local SDK.




## Resolution


The package the customer is trying to install contains /apps and it cannot be uploaded to an AEMaaCS instance via the package manager if it contains any immutable path.
At runtime only mutable areas like /content, /conf, etc can be modified.

This package should be deployed via the cloud manager pipeline, embedding it in the "all" module.

Also, please make sure that a third-party package is cloud service compatible.
