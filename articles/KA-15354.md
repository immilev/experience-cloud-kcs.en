# Delivery Analysis start/end dates not updating for deliveries

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue</b>
For recurring and continuous deliveries, the analysis start and end dates are not filled out until the delivery has finished.

<b>Cause</b>
This is due to the nature of these deliveries as they are constantly re-running/re-analyzing.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

NEO-20755 was opened to address this issue and has since been fixed in builds 9228 or newer.
