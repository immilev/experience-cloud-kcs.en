# Adobe Campaign: Queries against tsEvent take a long time

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When creating queries against the `tsEvent` field on the `nmsBroadLogRcp` table in Classic and Standard versions of Adobe Campaign, queries take a long time to return or timeout.


## Resolution


This is because there is no index on the `tsEvent` table out of the box. An enhancement (CAMP-37074) has been created to include an index in the out-of-the-box code moving forward.

In the meantime, it is recommended to either not query large subsets of data using the `tsEvent` field or manually add an index on the `tsEvent` field.
