# Uploading Google feed shows Unknown Error

## Description


We are trying to upload Google Feed, but its throiwing an "Unknown Error"


## Resolution


Provide an xml with a separate line for xml header
 Currently feed file is a big 1-liner starting with `?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?`, our code expects `?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?` to be in a separate line at the beginning of the file.
