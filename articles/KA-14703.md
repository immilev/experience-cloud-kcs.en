# Total number of users for each product in Admin Console

## Description


What does the total number of users for each product under Overview tab in Admin Console represent?

Steps: Admin Console  Overview

<b>Notice:</b> Each product tile shows number of users




## Resolution


This is not the actual number of users for each individual product. It is the sum of 'ENTITLED USERS' for the product.

*For example:* Under Overview tab in Admin Console Analytics users are 2012

Now to validate this number go to Admin Console  Products  select Analytics  Product Profiles and count the number of 'ENTITLED USERS'. This comes out to be 2012.

This means the number of users i.e 2012 (in the above example) is a duplicated number where a user that exists in 2 product profiles would be counted twice.
