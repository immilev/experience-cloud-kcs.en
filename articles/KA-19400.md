# Error "The requested database record does not exist"

## Description


Occasionally you experience following issue when trying to start a workflow, the following error message appears:

"SQL Statement ......"

"The requested database record does not exist."

"Cannot load document of type (instance_table) satisfying condition (condition) "

This even if the record in the database did exist.

This was only impacting some users, and the admins were able to run the workflow without error.


## Resolution


This can be a rights issue. Indeed, the folder in which the workflow was created was unavailable to the operator. The workflow was visible in the current folder but belonged to the "Administration  Production  Objects Created automatically  Campaign Workflows" folder, to which the user did not have the rights.

Granting the rights to the folder to the user corrected the issue.
