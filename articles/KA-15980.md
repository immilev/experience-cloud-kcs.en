# Campaign Classic: Integration of Data Lake with Adobe Campaign SFTP

## Description


It has been asked how the Data Lake can be integrated with the Adobe Campaign SFTP server.


## Resolution


In order to establish the communication, keys will need to be created at the Data Lake and provided to Adobe. The public key will need to then be allow listed.



This can also be done through the Control Panel if available.
