# Campaign Classic V7 - The "after" operator on a date field in Query Component is not returning correct results.

## Description



| The "after" operator on a date field in Query Component is not returning correct results. The query is still returning records where creation date = max creation date. What is the issue?<br><br><b>Steps to reproduce:</b><br><br>  - Go to any schema<br>  - Go to the data tab<br>  - Configure the list and add the Creation date field<br>  - Sort the list by Creation date in descending order, note the max creation date & time<br>  - Create a new workflow<br>  - Add a query component to the workflow<br>  - update the query to have a filter where Creation date "after" max creation date (noted from the previous step)<br>  - Ideally, the query should not return any records but still, it will return the records where creation date = max creation date |

## Resolution


<b>Cause</b>

The query in the workflow is working on the format “<b>hh:mm:ss.000</b>” which is in microseconds.

 This means that in this table the maximum date is 4.38.56 seconds but there are 6 unique records that have the maximum date as 4 hours, 38 min, 56 seconds, and further split like a (001 microseconds /002 microseconds  /003 microseconds  /004 microseconds  /005  microseconds  / 006 microseconds).

 That is why it fetches the records.

 Test by putting a query as '2017-10-18 16:38:57 PM' in the workflow” again. This will not fetch any result. This certifies that there are multiple records with the date 16:38:56 seconds as explained above.

<b>Resolution</b>

We can amend the workflow by adding 1 second to the maximum and that should solve the problem.
