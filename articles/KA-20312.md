# How disable Active Map data collection?

## Description

For some reason, we don't want to collect Active Map data anymore; how can we disable the Active Map data collection?
<br> 

## Resolution


- <b>If the Adobe Analytics library is managed on a customer server (AppMeasurement.js self-hosted )</b>


Delete the AppMeasurement_Module_ActivityMap module from the AppMeasurement.js file

- <b>If the Adobe Analytics library is managed on the Adobe side( AppMeasurement.js hosted via the Adobe CDN)</b>


In the AEP Data Collection(Launch) UI, go to  the configuration of Adobe Analytics Extension, and disable Activity Map by unchecked the box, then publish the build
