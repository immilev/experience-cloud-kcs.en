```



Environment
- Campaign Standard



## Resolution

Steps to Resolve
- Purge Workflow history - [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/managing-processes-and-data/executing-a-workflow/monitoring-workflow-execution.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/managing-processes-and-data/executing-a-workflow/monitoring-workflow-execution.html?lang=en)



<br><br>Cause<br><br>
Failure to delete the Workflow is due to the application attempting to write logs to the Workflow. This process can get stuck and to fix the issue, the workflow logs need to be purged. This stops the backend job and allows the workflow to be deleted.
