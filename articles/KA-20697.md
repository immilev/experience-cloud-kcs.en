# Adobe Analytics: Certain column values are empty in reports via Data Warehouse

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b><br> <br>Specific columns in Data Warehouse reports are exported with empty values. However, the values are reflected when I re-request the report later or export it after some time.

## Resolution {#resolution}


Please check the "Classification" setting of the dimension that became empty data once. If you are using the "Classification Importer" and "Classification Rule Builder," the value of this dimension may be empty because the classification process is taking time. As a specification, "Classification" takes around 72 hours to complete processing. Therefore, when a file is created in the Data Warehouse, the "Classification" process has not yet been completed, and the data may be empty. Please consider exporting after the classification reflection process has been completed beyond 72 hours.
