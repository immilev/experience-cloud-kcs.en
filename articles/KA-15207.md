# Campaign Standard - Can we receive default content even if we don’t pass any value in “AC_language” in the REST call?

## Description



| We have to click on the “initialize content variant” section to add multiple languages.<br>   <br>  In the content section, we have added default and English-Us content.<br>   <br>  Assuming that we have added the “AC_language” attribute in the event and published it, now in the REST code if we pass<br><br>  “AC_language”= “en_us” then it will trigger the “en_us” content. <br><br>  What if, we don't pass any value in “AC_language” section, will we receive default content? |

## Resolution


Yes, this is the expected behavior.
  
 The rule is that if in the event, there is AC_language AND if AC_language is corresponding to a known variant, then this variant will be used.
  
 Otherwise for all other cases, the 'default' variant will be used (if AC_language contains an unknown variant name, or if AC_language is empty or does not exist in the event).
