# Can a [!DNL Target] Audience be created based on cookie value?

## Description

Issue/Symptoms<br>
Unable to create a [!DNL Target] Audience based on cookie value.
<br>Environment<br>
Adobe Target without Adobe Launch




## Resolution

Steps to resolve<br><br>
There is no option in Adobe Target to create audience based on cookie value, but this can be done with help of Adobe Launch.

1. Go to data elements in Adobe Launch
2. Add data element
3. Name : Element_Name
4. Extension : Core
5. Data Element Type : Cookie
6. Default Value : None
7. Check Clean Text
8. Storage Duration : Page view / Session / Visitor - As per your requirement
9. Cookie Name : Cookie_Name
10. Save Data element
11. Pass it in your global mbox
12. Name: any name to capture in [!DNL Target]
13. [!UICONTROL Value] : Data element name that you created earlier




Go to Adobe Target.

1. Create [!UICONTROL Audience]
2. Rule - Custom - Type Name (which is passed in mbox through launch) - follow your conditions




Using Javascript, you can use a code snippet like the example below:


```
targetPageParams = function() {

var cookieValue = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:|.*;\s*)COOKIENAME\s*\=\s*(;*).*$)|.*$/, "$1");

              return "PARAMNAME="+cookieValue;

        };

/* replace `COOKIENAME` and `PARAMNAME` */
```
