# AMS users want to access OSGi console

## Description


The customer wants some users belonging to an Admin group to be able to access the Felix console - Configurations, bundles, etc (https://IP:PORT/system/console/configMgr)



<b>Environment</b>: AEM Managed Services


## Resolution


Please access the OSGi console using the Admin user - IP:PORT/system/console/configMgr, search & edit “Apache Sling Web Console Security Provider” and verify that the group your users are part of is added to the "Group Names".

If the group is not present here, please add it and the users will be able to access the OSGi console.
