# Property is not getting populated automatically when creating an activity in Target

## Description


Recently started using Adobe Launch and when creating an activity in Adobe Target, the respective property is not getting populated within Target UI automatically


## Resolution


Please follow below steps to ensure that the property is detected inside VEC as well as sent in mbox call. Here are the steps -

- Create Property in Launch
- Create a new Data Element as 'at_property' and add value of your property. (Make sure that name of data element is at_property). Select Extension as Core and data Element Type as Custom Code.
- Create a new Ruleand ensure that order of Actions is  <u>Adobe Target-Load Target THEN Adobe Target- Add Params to Global mbox THEN <b>Core-Custom Code</b> THEN Adobe Target - Fire Global mbox</u>
- Create library and include above data element & rule.
