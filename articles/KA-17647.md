# Trouble Shoot: A4T | Target activities not show up in Analytics workspace

## Description

The content of Target activity is delivered on the page, but data does not display on Analytics report.

## Resolution


1. Confirm the Analytics report suite used in Target activity is used in the test page also.

1.1 Check the Report Suite in Activity's reporting settings.

1.2 Check the report suite of test page via browser network by "/b/ss/" filter.

1.3 If the report suite of Target report settings is different from that used in the test page, then change it. If no, then move on to 2.

2. Confirm the data stitching between Target and Analytics.

2.1 In the test page, open browser network tab.

2.2 Check the mboxMCSDID parameter of Target request via filter "tt.omtrdc.net"

2.3 Check the sdid parameter of Analytics request via filter "/b/ss/"

2.4 If the value of mboxMCSDID is different from the vaule of sdid, then check the order of execution of Target and Analytics call. Target call should always be executed before Analytics.
