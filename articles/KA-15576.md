# Property token of the page is not identified by Target VEC

## Description


Target VEC is not able to recognize property token of the page correctly. VEC displays warning message “No property token found on this page”, while creating the activity.


## Resolution


Let us first understand, <b>how "at_property" is used during "authoring" and "delivery"?</b>

<b>Authoring - </b>
 When a customer loads his page/SPA in VEC, VEC scans the page to find the <b>window.targetPageParams </b>function. If it finds this function it will execute it and try to extract the "at_property" value and based on this value determine the workspace for this property. If VEC can't find this function or this function is missing then VEC will default to default workspace.

<b>Delivery -</b>
 During delivery Target edge doesn't consider where "at_property" value is coming from. As long as the property value is passed in the  request everything is  going to work correctly.


<b>How it works in Launch?</b>
 Having these two modes of operation outlined, I have to explain what happens in Launch. In Launch customers can add parameters to Launch actions in any way they want, hence usually "at_property" is passed as a parameter to "Fire global mbox request". This works great for delivery, however when loading the site in VEC, since there is no <b>window.targetPageParams </b>VEC is not able to pickup the correct workspace.

<b>Workaround :</b>
 One way to get around this issue and make sure that  VEC works as expected, is to ask customers to create a Launch custom code action that would define the <b>window.targetPageParams </b>function with "at_property". Customer would have to make sure that this action is executed right before loading Target library or firing global mbox request.

 An alternative would be to adjust VEC so there is native integration between VEC and Adobe Launch, but this would require proper scoping and it will take more time to implement.



<b>Steps of Workaround:</b>

1. Create a Launch custom code action that would define the window.targetPageParams function with "at_property".

*window.targetPageParams = function() {return {"at_property" : "%atproperty%"}; }*

2. Also make sure that this action is executed right before loading Target library or firing global mbox request



The above steps should ensure that VEC recognize the property correctly while creating the activity.
