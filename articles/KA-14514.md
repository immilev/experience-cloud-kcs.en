# Activity based on [!UICONTROL Time Frame] targeting not working

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 Activity based on Time Frame targeting does not work correctly.

<b>Steps to replicate:</b>

1. Create an activity that runs only on Wednesday and Sunday.
2. Include the time frame as:

    1. [!UICONTROL Week and Day Parting]
    2. Wednesday - [!UICONTROL All Day]
    3. Sunday - [!UICONTROL All Day]

        


<b>Expected results:</b>
 The activity runs as expected. This activity runs at sharp 00:00 of every Wednesday and Sunday.

<b>Actual results:</b>
 Due to this setup, the activity runs only on Wednesday and Sunday.

The lag of around 15-20 minutes occurs when the activity runs.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The time which needs to be input in the <b>[!UICONTROL Time Frame]</b> audience is GMT +5 time.

Example:
If you need the activity to be delivered from Friday 00:00 to Friday 23:59, then you can configure the time as Thursday 23:30 to Friday: 23:30.
