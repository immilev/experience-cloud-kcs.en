# Adobe Campaign Standard: mirror page not preview doesn't work.

## Description


When accessing the mirror pages via the delivery logs, the preview of the mirror page fails with:

*"This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue."*


## Resolution


Reason:

This is a limitation of the product that occurs when a campaign instance has many brandings ( 25). When a campaign instance has more than 25 brandings, code building HTTP Header 'Content-Security-Policy' uses a paginated list of brandings limited to 25 entities. Consequently, all brandings are not used when building this Header. The occurrence of the error will depend on whether the delivery is linked with a branding that is part of the first 25 returned branding by the security code or not.

An improvement request has already been logged to address this issue.
