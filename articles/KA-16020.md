# ACS - Dynamic Report matrix for the delivery

## Description


Could you please help me in checking on the following 2 queries and let me know if this is possible in ACS:-
  
 1.) <b>When we save the report for a specific delivery in ACS, it pulls metric details for all the campaigns sent from the ACS instance and not the one which we was being displayed initially.</b> Is this a bug ? If yes, is it already raised with our ACS product team ?
  
 2.) Need to confirm if there is a way to do the following in reports :-
     
      a.) Pull specific delivery names under Delivery Statics table
      b.) Pull metric based on the number of deliveries used in a workflow by selecting the workflow name itself
      c.) Option to edit/modify/choose deliveries under Delivery Statics table


## Resolution


ANSWER RECEIVED :-



For point 1, creating a custom report saves the look and feel of the workspace, like dimensions you are using, or metrics you are displaying. It won’t save the filters. This way you can reuse one report for multiple deliveries/filters.

So, this is expected behavior



For point 2

1. Yes, you can drag and drop any delivery in the Delivery statistics table to see numbers for it.
2. Workflow information is not there in reporting system, so this is not possible
3. I don’t understand what you mean by edit, but you can drag and drop any delivery/other dimension  here.
