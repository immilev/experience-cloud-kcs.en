# Changing a Analytics classification value set by a classification rule builder, with a manual classification file upload

## Description


Sometimes a user might want to manually change a key value that has been classified by a set of classifications rules.


## Resolution


The act of trying to manually over write a classification value set by a rule set, will trigger a rerun of the classification rules, changing the manual classified value (upload) back to whatever the rule set says it should be.

The only way to over write a classifications value being classifed by a rule, is to create a new (more specific) rule to classify the key as desired
