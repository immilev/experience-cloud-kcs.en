# Campaign Classic V7 - How to get Campaign Optimization package installed?

## Description


The Typology Pressure and Capacity rules are added as part of an independent package installation i.e. Campaign Optimization and if they are missing it is due to the module "<b>Campaign Optimization</b>" not installed.

 This module is needed to enable pressure rules application on deliveries.


## Resolution


Customers with instances hosted by Adobe should contact Support to have the package installed if they are eligible for "Campaign Optimization" module.

If the customer's pack is not eligible, then need to contact their Customer Success Manager or Adobe Account Executive to purchase the required licence(s).

The module would then be added.
