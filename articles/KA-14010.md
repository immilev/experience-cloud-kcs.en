# Auto Allocate Activities: Lift and confidence not shown for Secondary metrics

## Description


When changing the report metrics, the lift and confidence values remain unchanged in Target activity reports. Why?


Target



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

- No lift bounds are displayed for [!UICONTROL Auto Allocate] activities until one experience has attained 60% confidence.
- Lift and confidence are not updated for secondary metrics for [!UICONTROL Auto Allocate] activities.


When changing the report metrics, the lift and confidence values remain unchanged in Target activity reports. Why?


## Resolution




Auto-allocation consumes only the primary goal metric to train the underlying AA model and determine the winning experience as the test matures. Other/additional metrics do not play any role there, unlike manual AB tests, where one can compare experiences based on any given metric and push the winner manually in the end. Providing lift, confidence, etc., for non-primary goal metrics will not be right in this case. So, if you want to compute the statistics and compare the experiences based on an additional metric, this is to be done manually.
