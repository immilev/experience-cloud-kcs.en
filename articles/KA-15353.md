# SCR-160012 JS error compile delivery marks recipient unreachable

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue</b>
In 9032 of [!DNL Campaign], when a delivery attempts to compile and send to some recipients, and if HTML content errors like the one below are hit:


```
SCR-160012 JavaScript: error while evaluating script content htmlContent
```


then the recipient is flagged as unreachable and quarantined.


## Resolution


<b>Workaround</b>

Currently there isn't a way around this issue, other than the workaround to pull the recipients out of quarantine and attempt to resend a delivery.

NEO-23161 has been opened and being investigated by Adobe R&D for a permanent fix in a future release.
