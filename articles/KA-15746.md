# Performance Test Always Access Site Root Page

## Description



```
Performance test of Cloud Manager always accesses site root page, even if the test set is new pages. Site root page means the url without path (e.g. https://www.example.com). If the site root page is not accessible, the performance test will fail.
```



## Resolution



```
This is the expected behaviour. The 'new' pages selection refers to the actual performance test. The crawler is executed first in order to identify which pages are available.
```
