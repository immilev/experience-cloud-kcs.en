# Campaign Classic V7 - Can we have an additional access (user) who can access the existing Adobe SFTP folders?

## Description


A customer wanted to share a different SFTP Account and Folder within the Adobe SFTP.

 They wanted to know if a subfolder could be created and access provided to a new User or if they can have one additional access (user) who can access their existing Adobe-hosted SFTP folders?


## Resolution


A separate SFTP account cannot be created and that is why this is not applicable. Therefore, the creation of a subfolder is not possible.

We can provide additional alias accounts, that is, other usernames and passwords that actually point to the same real account (same directory and same permissions).
