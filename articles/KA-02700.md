# Can sent email "[!UICONTROL From]:" address be changed after sharing Brand Portal asset?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
AEM and Brand Portal

<b>Issue</b>
Customers use the Brand Portal to share and distribute assets.

Email is sent from the `no-reply@adobe.com` email address.

How can the <b>[!UICONTROL From]:</b> email address be changed to the company's email address?


## Resolution


Brand Portal is a multi-tenant setup, allowing every customer/tenant to setup their own <b>[!UICONTROL From]:</b> email address as a feature request.

Brand Portal is hosted in Adobe datacenters.

If the <b>[!UICONTROL From]: </b>email address domain (for example, the customer's email address domain) is different from where the email was routed, it would likely end up in a spam folder.

Since the <b>[!UICONTROL From]:</b> email address is `noreply@adobe.com` and the initial routing mail server is also within Adobe, the email won't end up in a spam folder.

It is not currently possible to change the <b>[!UICONTROL From]:</b> email address to any other address. This issue will be addressed in a future release.
