# Rendering errors generate "unreachable" delivery failures

## Description


While preparing deliveries, you may experience the following Javascript error "unreachable." It seems to be a rendering error (variable not defined) that should have failed during the delivery preparation.


## Resolution


This behavior is expected. Basically, this type of error (Javascript errors) can only be detected during the message personalisation phase that occurs after the delivery preparation i.e. before sending emails. Please note that the message personalisation is driven by the MTA (mail transport agent) process so due the Javascript error, the email is set as "unreachable" by the MTA. The reason field shows why the email cannot be reached.
