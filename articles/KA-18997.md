<b>EEC issues troubleshooting steps:</b>

<b>1. Getting EEC errors like "Your website domain is blocking the Enhanced Experience Composer" or EEC won’t load an internal QA URL that is not accessible on public IP.</b>

Ask the customer to whitelist the following DNS/IPs in case you see Timeout or other 400 messages in these requests in the Network or in the Console tab from Chrome Developer Tools:

US:
 vizproxy-prod-us-2024941706.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
 54.173.241.58
 3.234.111.144
 EMEA:
 vizproxy-prod-emea-1118976074.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
 34.246.105.190
 34.249.15.238
 APAC:
 vizproxy-prod-apac-1398366183.ap-northeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
 52.192.148.53

<b>2.  TLS Issue</b>

<b>Follow the below steps to check the TLS version of the website:</b>

a. Right-click on the affected page and open inspect element (developer console)

b. In the developer console, we can see 3 dots in the rightmost top corner (next to the gear icon). Click on it and expand the more tools option.

c. Select the security option. Under security, we would be able to see our TLS version.
