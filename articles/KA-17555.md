# Getting XML-110011 Unable to find element 'element' with attribute 'name' set to 'fusion' (document with schema)

## Description

<b>For On-prem users</b><br><br> <br><br>After upgrading a Campaign instance to ACC-21.1 build 9342 or higher, when I try to install any Campaign packages, I get the following error:<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___967b605d-41d0-ec11-a7b5-0022480a8e40___.png)

## Resolution


The fusion schema (xtk:fusion) should be deleted in process of postupgrade. But in some cases, the schema is still present.

When you query the database as follow, you may see the following records:

To remove the xtk:fusion schema, you need to run the postupgrade tool with the "-force" option:

`nlserver config -postupgrade -allinstances -force`

You should see the following:

If the schema is still present, you can try with the "-force -repair" options:

`nlserver config -postupgrade -allinstances -force -repair`

If it still does not work, you may have to remove manually the records from the database.
