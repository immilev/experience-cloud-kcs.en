## Description


<b>Environment</b>

<b>Issue</b>
 By default in ACS, users are unable to add <b>[!UICONTROL Control] Type</b> typology rules.

<b>Cause</b>

1. Export in a package a typology rule of type [!UICONTROL Control].
2. Update the exported xml file to adapt with your needs.
3. Import the changed xml file .
