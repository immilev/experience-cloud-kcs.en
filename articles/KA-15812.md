# Campaign Classic - Enrichment and Query activity- All rows options is giving the error

## Description


Using the ‘All Rows’ option with Enrichment or Query activity results in an error “BAS-010000 Unable to complete the operation in current status.


## Resolution


The "All rows" option is working fine after clicking on Finish (instead of next) and then running the workflow. There seems to be a minor issue with UI and the "next" button should be disabled after changing to the "all rows" option.
