# Adobe Campaign: Push notifications fail due to APNS mapping to APNS_SANDBOX

## Description


It has been reported that for push notifications, Campaign will display 100% sent but no push notifications make it to the recipients.

One of the reasons found for this is a misconfiguration on the pipelineD service where APNS is mapping to APNS_SANDBOX.


## Resolution


The issue was addressed in CAMP-37240 which required a configuration change to the pipelineD process.

Documented change to serverConf.xml:


```
topic endpoint="" name="mccs_push_notifications_feedback" pipelineName=""
        consume endpoint="" group="$(INSTANCE_NAME)_new" pipelineName=""/
      /topic
```
