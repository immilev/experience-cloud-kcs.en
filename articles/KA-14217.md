# Adobe Campaign: API 504 timeout errors

## Description

<br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
- Receiving 504 errors when making API calls to [!DNL Campaign]



Environment
- [!DNL Apache] `RequestReadTimeout` option is set to 20 seconds (default setting)



## Resolution

Steps to Resolve/Workaround
- Increase this timeout to match with the [!DNL Amazon ELB] (60 seconds) as some API calls can go over the default 20 seconds and time out.
