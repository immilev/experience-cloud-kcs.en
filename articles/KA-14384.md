# GET request to REST API to retrieve OrgUnits fails

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 In ACS, a `GET` request to REST API to retrieve OrgUnits fails with the following error message:


```
RST-360011 An error has occurred - please get in touch with your administrator.

Error rc=-2003
```



## Resolution


Try to "re-publish" the data by republishing the data model via [!UICONTROL Administration] | [!UICONTROL Development] | [!UICONTROL Publishing,] and re-republish the data model.

The new service should then be added when completing the step.
