# When personalization blocks are deleted, RT templates can't be published

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Campaign Classic


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
If any personalization block is deleted and reference is removed from the transactional message template in the *STAGE*and *DEV* environment. In that case, an error mentioning *personalization block doesn't exist*occurs while publishing the template.


## Resolution


As confirmed by Adobe Engineering, this is not a System bug, and there's no need to remove the personalization block from the Delivery template XML.

This was raised as an Enhancement Request for a feature where once a personalization block is removed from Delivery HTML, its reference should be removed from Delivery source XML as well. The Reference number of the Enhancement Request is *NEO-26625*.
