# How to unlock a locked page

## Description

A page is locked either manually or programmatically. The user (or object) that put the lock on the page can break the lock. However, if the user is not available or the object forgets to unlock the page, is there another way to break the lock of that page?<br><br><br>

## Resolution


The "`admin`" account can unlock any page by opening the page and clicking on "Unlock Page" from the page properties drop down

<b>NOTE</b>: The original user holding the lock does have permission to unlock the page. However, other users, even if a member of the administrators group, DO NOT have the right to unlock pages that have been locked. Only the "`admin`" account has this right.
