# Analytics Marketing Channel Instances on Custom Links

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Do instances of Marketing Channel get counted on custom links (non-page view hits)?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Marketing Channel rules that are based on referrer information <b>will</b> cause a Marketing Channel instance on custom links (non-page view hits).
However, Marketing Channels based on page URL, included query strings, will <b>NOT</b> count a Marketing Channel instance on customer links.
This is because the referrer is available on custom links for Marketing Channel rules, but the `page_url` is not.
