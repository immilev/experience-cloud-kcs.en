# Form-based Experience Composer - "clicked an mbox" is not capturing visitors in reports

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
I have a forms experience setup on my homepage using the global *mbox*. I've setup click tracking, but I'm not seeing the metrics aggregate in reporting. I have a backup metric that counts the pageviews of pages where the links go. So, I know users are seeing these pages, but the clicks aren't registering as I would expect. See below for more details.



I'm tracking clicks using the following script (there are five buttons across five image carousel slides).




```
// Adobe Target Tracking    document.querySelectorAll('li.glide__slide div.info a').forEach(link = {        link.addEventListener('click', event = {            adobe.target.trackEvent({                    "mbox": "July2020_CarouselTest",                    "params": {                    "ctaClick": link.getAttribute('href')                }            });        })    });
```




I can see the *mbox* request, when I use Adobe Experience Platform Debugger and click one of the elements. See the screenshot below:

In my Target activity, I've created a *Conversion Metric* targeting the *mbox* mentioned above. I have a refining audience requiring a value be present in the *CTA Click* parameter. See the below screenshots detailing this:

As a safeguard, I've added an additional metric without the refining audience. Metrics aren't aggregating in activity reporting for this metric either.

Finally, as a third backup, I've added the pageviews where the button clicks lead to as a metric. Activity reporting <b>is showing pageviews to these pages</b>.



Why isn't activity reporting showing any conversions on my trackevent associated clicks?


## Resolution


To use the <b>Clicked on mbox</b> method you need to wrap an *mbox* around the CTA and let the user actually click on it. I believe you should try <b>Viewed an mbox</b> as you are firing the *mbox* after they click on it.
