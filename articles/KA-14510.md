# Stuck in an Infinite Loop for Redirect Activity

## Description


I want to redirect 50% of the traffic from a page to the same page with a parameter added – is it possible to do this? I tried but get an infinite redirect loop.




## Resolution


The issue of the infinite redirect loop is happening because experience B URL(redirecting Exp) again qualifies the visitors for the activity. Hence the visitor is entering into the loop of qualifying for the activity multiple times.

In order to resolve this you need to exclude(through template testing) Experience B URL to qualify for the activity.
