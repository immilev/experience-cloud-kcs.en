# ACS - Content fragment duplicates itself in the [!UICONTROL Email designer]

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 When opening a delivery in the [!UICONTROL Email designer,] which has a header included (content fragment), the header duplicates itself.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
This issue can occur when a nested fragment is present in the HTML.

It can occur when creating a template, inserting a fragment, and changing the template flag into a fragment one, and this is not supported by the editor.

To solve this, the content fragment can be recreated from scratch, or the nested fragment can be removed manually.
