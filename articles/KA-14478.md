# ACS - Content fragment duplicates itself in the Email Designer

## Description


When opening a delivery in the Email Designer which has a header included (content fragment), the header duplicates itself.


## Resolution


This issue can occur when a nested fragment is present in the HTML.

The issue can occur when creating a template, inserting a fragment and changing the template flag into a fragment one - this is not supported by the editor.

To solve this the content fragement can be recreated from scrach or the nested fragment can be removed manually.
