# [Report Builder] Limit on the number of days

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 What is the limit on the number of days in a single Report Builder request with daily granularity?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The answer is 371 days.
It was designed with a hard limit of 366 days (considering the number of days in a leap year), but it failed to accommodate 5-4-4 calendars on leap years (53 weeks = 371 days).
It was re-calibrated to allow up to 371 days, when required.
It won't permit beyond 371 days.
