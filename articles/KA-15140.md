# No images in transactional email

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
- Images don't display in transactional emails sent from the [!UICONTROL Message Center]. The error message in the email says *The linked image cannot be displayed*, and a red cross shows.
- The image URLs are visible in the <b>[!UICONTROL Tracking & Images]</b> tab of the delivery template with the status Skipped (do not put online).
- Images are visible if the message is sent as proof.
- The image is uploaded to the Public resources, and when the image URL is pasted in a browser, the image can be displayed.



## Resolution






Check the HTML source code of the email delivery and verify the image URLs to see where the images are hosted and if the URL corresponds with the public resource URL of the instance.



Proofs for transactional messages are sent directly from the marketing instance; they don't go through the [!UICONTROL Message Center], so the fact that Proof is ok is irrelevant.



If image URLs don't match, update them correctly in the transactional message template and republish the template to the [!UICONTROL Message Center].


<b>Cause</b>
When a template is developed in stage and imported to the production environment without changing the URLs, and the URLs do not match the published URL, the images don't show correctly in the email.
