# Notifications sent from wrong domain after database refresh

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Workflow notifications after database refresh are sent from the production domain, and links in the content redirect to the production workflows.


## Resolution


Check if after refresh:

- In [!UICONTROL Deployment Wizard], sender mask and address point to stage and not production.
- Check if the options below point to stage and not production:


`NmsDelivery_FromAddressMasks`
`NmsDelivery_ErrorAddressMasks`
`NmsServer_URL`
`NmsServer_IntranetURL`



- Check if the notification templates have the *From* field empty. if they do, they will pick up the options values.
- Templates must be found under <b>[!UICONTROL Administration]</b> - <b>[!UICONTROL Campaign Management]</b> - <b>[!UICONTROL Technical Delivery] templates</b>.




If all is good, but notifications are still sent from the wrong domain:

The approval/notification emails are all sent from the same technical recurring delivery that was analyzed and prepared long ago when the parameters were still pointing to production.

This means that any changes made in the options are not considered in these notification emails, as no new delivery preparation had to be done.

To fix it, stop the technical delivery *[!UICONTROL Notification of the assignees for a workflow task]* under <b>[!UICONTROL Administration]</b> - <b>[!UICONTROL Production]</b> - <b>[!UICONTROL Objects created automatically]</b> - <b>[!UICONTROL Technical deliveries]</b> - <b>[!UICONTROL Workflow notifications]</b>.

A new notification will create a new delivery with the latest and correct variables.
