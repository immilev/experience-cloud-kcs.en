# Why do some Analytic schedule project recipients not receive scheduled workspace projects

## Description


Occasionally, a recipient of a scheduled report or project may be unsubscribed from the email.


## Resolution


This action is either performed by the recipient directly or in some cases, users can be auto-unsubscribed by their company email server.

Please have your IT/Security team add "adobe.com" and "omniture.com" to mail server whitelist.

Some anti-phishing filters run all links in an email. If this check includes the unsubscribe link this will unsubscribe the user.



Additional note:

Adobe Analytics scheduled reports/project unsubscribe requests are not authenticated. This is so customers to send reports to non-Adobe Analytics users.
