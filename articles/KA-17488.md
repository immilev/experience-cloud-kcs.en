1. [Bundle Version Checker](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/bundle-version-checker.html) - Compare the versions of Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) bundles installed across AEM versions or across environments.
2. [OSGi Component Diff](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/osgi-component-diff.html) - Compare the OSGi components across AEM environments.
3. [OSGi Configuration Diff](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/osgi-configuration-diff.html) - Compare the OSGi configurations across AEM environments.
4. [Content Package Compare](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/content-package-comparator.html) - Compare content packages installed across AEM environments.
5. [Activity Log Analyzer](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/activity-log-analyzer.html) - Validate the node additions and deletions that are done during the package installations.
6. [Node Diff](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/aem-node-diff.html) - Check nodes across environments using Content Repository Extreme Development Environment (CRX/DE) query service.
