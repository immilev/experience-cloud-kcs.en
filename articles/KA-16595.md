# OOTB way to export DAM asset to Target

## Description

Is there any OOTB way to export DAM assets from AEM to Target?<br><br><br>

## Resolution


There is no OOTB option to export assets to Target. Only XF can be exported to Target.



As AEM should be your centralised DAM, it is ideal to host assets in AEM and use the Link of the asset to replace an asset in target to avoid duplication in multiple sources.
