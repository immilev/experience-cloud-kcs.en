# Basic information about SAINT file header

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
What does column C3 represent in the file header for the Saint classifications template? Does it have an impact on the FTP saint upload process?


## Resolution


The first is a numeric identifier (not to be used for any other purpose) of the report suite. The second part is the relation ID of the classification variable (conversion/traffic variable).

Since these numbers are related to the report suite and classification being used, they do impact the FTP upload/classification process.
