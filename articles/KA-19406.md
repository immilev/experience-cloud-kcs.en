# Is it possible to restore a deleted delivery?

## Description




Is it possible to restore a delivery if deleted by accident?


## Resolution


In ACS, there is no recycle bin to recover deleted deliveries from.

Hence, if delivery is deleted, there is no standard way to restore it.

Point in time recovery of the entire database can be explored if it is critical and necessary to have the deleted delivery(ies) back. However, that will lead to data loss for the period elapsed since then,
