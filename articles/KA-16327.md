# Adobe Campaign Standard: How to prevent workflows from inserting blank org units

## Description


It has been reported that the Campaign application allows for profiles to be inserted into the database from a workflow without an OrgID.  This will cause the profile record to throw errors if accessed.


## Resolution


Currently an enhancement has been submitted for this (CAMP-45730) to include guardrails to prevent this from occurring in the future.
