# Adobe Campaign Standard: Copied Workflow deliveries throw error stating start date must be specified

## Description


It has been reported that when a delivery has been copied it can state that the schedule is "defined upstream in the workflow" when the schedule is actually blank. Upon execution of the delivery, a failure is triggered stating that the start date is not specified.


## Resolution


Simply set/replace the schedule date and execute the delivery.

CAMP-50079 has been created to update the UI to throw a warning ahead of time for the user to understand that the contact/schedule date is blank.
