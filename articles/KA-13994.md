# "noData.erMissing algoId" appears in recommendations trace on the page

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
`"noData.erMissing algoId"`  error appears randomly on the first-page load of activity URL. [!DNL Recommendations] work fine on refresh without any error.


## Resolution


It happens for entities not cached at the Target edge server. On refresh, R3 edge gets the result and delivers entity recommendations for the same page, which did not deliver on the first hit.

To avoid this, there is a privilege available in client settings of choosing consistency over speed.



<u>Steps for the above configuration:</u>

1. Log in to <b>[!DNL Recommendations classic] </b>and Click on <b>[!UICONTROL Edit]</b> against the required account.

2. Ensure "[!UICONTROL Redirect to central on first NoContentDataException]" is selected.

*<u>The above configuration ensures that if the R3 edge does not have the recommended entities, the results would be fetched from the central server. This may lead to a delay in fetching the results on the first page load. However, it would ensure consistent recommendation results on each page load.</u>*
