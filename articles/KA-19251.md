# AEP - How to run an on-demand evaluation for a specific segment

## Description


Say you have an Edge segment and you'd like to do random evaluation checks to see how the segment is evolving during a specific timeframe, without having to wait for the daily batch evaluation.

*NB: Edge segmentation is the ability to evaluate segments in Adobe Experience Platform instantaneously on the edge*



This is related to the following documentation: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html#on-demand-evaluation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html#on-demand-evaluation)

*On-demand evaluation allows you to create a segment job in order to generate an audience segment whenever you require it. Unlike scheduled evaluation, this will happen only when requested and is not recurring.*




<br><br> <br><br>

## Resolution


This can be achieved via what we call an <b>on-demand evaluatio</b>n where you can create a new segment job by making a POST request to the /segment/jobs endpoint in the Real-time Customer Profile API.



Here is a way to do this:



- First, you'll need to create a segment job specifically for this segment, using:


POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs with the following body:

*<br>    {
<br>        "segmentId": "segmentID_value"
<br>    }*



I got Segment Job ID "id": "*segmentJobID_value*"



- Then I checked the status of the segment job using the following:


GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs/*segmentJobID_value*



This is going through different processing stages until it succeeds

*"status": "QUEUED",
<br> "status": "PROCESSING",
<br> "status": "SUCCEEDED",*



- Results:


*"segmentedProfileCounter": {
<br>            "segmentID_value": 21
<br>        },*

*},
<br>        "segmentedProfileByStatusCounter": {
<br>            "segmentID_value": {
<br>                "existing": 18,
<br>                "realized": 3,
<br>*



*NB: This segment was showing a population of 19 profiles, it went up to 21 following our on-demand segment job and this was outside of the daily batch evaluation.*
