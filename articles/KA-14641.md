# Difference between [!DNL Target] Visitors and [!DNL Analytics] Visitors

## Description


<b>Issue</b>

What is the difference between [!DNL Target] Visitors and [!DNL Analytics] Unique Visitors?


## Resolution


The difference between the [!DNL Target] report metric "[!UICONTROL Visitors]" and the [!DNL Analytics] report metric "Unique Visitors"  is given below:

<u><b>[!DNL Target] Visitor</b></u> is a participant in the activity for the life of the campaign. The visitor will be counted as a new entrant if he or she visits the site from a new computer or a new browse, deletes the cookie, or converts and returns to the activity with the same cookie. An entrant is identified by the PCID in the visitor's mbox cookie. If the PCID changes, the person is considered a new visitor.

<b>[!DNL Analytics] Unique visitors</b> refer to visitors who visit a site for the first time within a specified time period. For example, a unique visitor can visit a site ten times in a week, but if the time period is a week, a single unique visitor is counted only once for that week.
