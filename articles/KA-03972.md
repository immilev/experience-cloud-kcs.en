# What permissions are needed for users to download assets from AEM DAM?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
AEM 6.x

<b>Issue</b>
You want to disable the download button in the touch UI, but need to know the permission associated with the download functionality.

What permissions are needed to allow users to download assets from AEM DAM?


## Resolution


The ability to download assets is associated with the `jcr:read` permission.

If you can read an asset, you can download the asset.

If you want to disable the download button even though there is permission to read the assets, you will need to overlay this functionality.
