# Campaign Classic - Table not populated in Descriptive analysis

## Description


When we export Descriptive Analysis report, the graph gets exported by the Chart part doesn’t.


## Resolution


Our Engineering Team has accepted this as an Enhancement Request as the report gets extracted correctly if the excel option is used and the chart section is getting exported correctly.

This problem was fixed in the 21.1.4 release (build 9343) and onwards.
