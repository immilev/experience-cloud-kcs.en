# Getting AEM log files quickly for users who don't have access to the file system

## Description


In corporate organisations, for security purposes,  it is common to have AEM administrator rights and OS level rights (especially file system access rights) separated to different individuals.

In this case the AEM administrator needs to request the OS administrator to send him the log files. This might be problematic when it comes to urgent issues that require quick investigations.


## Resolution


AEM provides 2 ways to access the logs without the need of special rights. You only need to have access rights to the AEM Web Console or the administrative tools section of AEM. Here a the 2 options:
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>


<b>AEM Web Console Log Files Page</b>

Browse/export them directly from the AEM Web Console Log Files page: http://localhost:4502/system/console/status-slinglogs
![Logs Page](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/kb/getting-log-files-directly-from-aem/jcr%3acontent/main-pars/image.img.png/Capture1.PNG "Logs Page")<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
The page displays each AEM log files one after the other as text.

You can download the log files using one of the 4 download buttons displayed on the top-right.

- Download As Text = a single .txt file containing all the logs
- Download As Zip =  a zip file containing all the logs in seperate files
- Download Full Text = a single .txt file containing all the logs + all the configurations and status available in the Web Console
- Download Full Zip = a zip file containing all the logs + all the configurations and status available in the Web Console in separate files

<br><br><br><br> <br><br>


<b>System Diagnosis Page</b>

Download a system status ZIP export from the system diagnosis page: http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/operations/content/diagnosis.html (select “Download Status ZIP”)
![Diagnosis Page](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/kb/getting-log-files-directly-from-aem/jcr%3acontent/main-pars/image_0.img.png/Capture2.PNG "Diagnosis Page")<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
The ZIP downloaded will contain many configuration and status files including a folder with all the log files of AEM.
