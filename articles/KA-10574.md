# Page throws NullPointerException upon activation in AEM sites

## Description


<b>Issue </b>
 When a page is activated in AEM, the activation fails with the following exception:


```
javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.doGet(ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.java:175)
at org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet.mayService(SlingSafeMethodsServlet.java:269)
```


<b>Environment</b>
 AEM 6.x

<b>Cause </b>
 One of the images referenced by the page had an issue with its properties.

The image causing issues was missing the `cq:lastReplicated` property while it had the `cq:lastReplicatedBy` and `cq:lastReplicationAction` properties.

  
<b>Specified Messages</b>


```
javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.doGet
at org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet.mayService
```



## Resolution


<b>Resolution</b>

1. Identify all the images which have this conflict:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM dam:Asset AS parent INNER JOIN nt:base AS child ON ISCHILDNODE(child,parent) WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(parent, '/content/dam/journey/') AND child.cq:lastReplicated IS NULL AND child.cq:lastReplicatedBy IS NOT NULL
    ```

2. Once the assets are identified, check if these assets were actually replicated or not.
3. If <b>Yes</b>, add the property `cq:lastReplicated` with the type <b>Date</b> and copy the date from the publish server.
4. In either case, you can remove the `cq:lastReplicatedBy` and `cq:lastReplicatedAction` properties, and activate the image again.
