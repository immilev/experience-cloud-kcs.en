# Javascript code error: "allocation size overflow"

## Description

<br>Allocation size overflow error in Javascript<br><br>

<br><br>This type of memory issue where the memory allocated for each query in JS trying to access the database goes beyond the limit set in the server configuration file.<br><br>E.g., when you execute delivery to LINE with 30K recipients and call Post-processing to generate the file to LINE, the JS code that reads the file to variables throws an error:<br><br>"allocation size overflow"<br><br>









## Resolution

<b>How to resolve this error?</b>


This error can be resolved in two ways:



1. You can raise the memory allocated in the serverConf.xml:



!-- Configuring the JavaScript interpreter

maxMB :  Maximum size in megabytes before running the garbage collector Default: 64

stackSizeKB :  Size of each stack chunk in kilo octets Default: 8 --

javaScript maxMB="512" stackSizeKB="8"/



Note: For Hosted server, the Adobe TechOps team would perform this task. For On-Premise, clients have to make the changes on their own.



*(<b>Tip: </b><b>increasing Javascript from 64MB to 512MB is needed for custom and complex reports on large tables.</b>)*



2. Use something like linecount=no of records to retrieve or noLineCount =true when creating the query def.



It would look like queryDef schema=schemaName operation= Select lineCount= 100000 or noLineCount=true



However, the above option may work for some counts and not if the count goes beyond a specific value.
