# AAM Traits importing from Campaign not populating

## Description

Do you have a Campaign workflow exporting data to Audience Manager, but the traits aren't populating in AAM? This article will help verify that your AAM configuration is ingesting the correct ID types that the Campaign workflow is exporting. 

## Resolution


You'll need a Campaign workflow exporting to Audience Manager, as well as an onboarded AAM trait configured to ingest the data. 

 Steps to verify the configuration:

A. Navigate to the general tab of the Campaign workflow, and verify the Shared Data Source field is set to the correct ID type which is being exported.
      i. Declared IDs are equivalent to your own customer IDs, which are often hashed emails.
     ii.Visitor IDs are equivalent to Adobe Experience Cloud IDs, which are generated for site visitors via Adobe's ID service.

B. Navigate to the AAM trait configured to ingest the Campaign data
      i. Ensure the data source matches your selection in the previous step.
     ii. For Declared IDs, the standard data source name should resemble: <b>A</b><b>dobe Campaign – Declared ID
<br>    iii. </b> For Visitor IDs, the standard data source name should resemble: <b>Adobe Campaign – MID</b>
