# Target AEM Integration may cause an error which says 'invalid workspace'

## Description


When integrating AEM and Target using IMS, an error that says "invalid workspace" has been seen in the error.log file of AEM when passing an XF from AEM to Target.


## Resolution


As a workaround, please try to use the legacy way of integration and see if this resolves the invalid workspace error.
