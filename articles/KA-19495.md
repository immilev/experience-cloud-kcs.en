# AEP - SFTP source connector fails connecting with the provided authentication credentials using SSH key

## Description

You are trying to set up and SFTP source connector within AEP. The SFTP source connector fails connecting with the provided authentication credentials using SSH key.<br><br>You may be using PuttyGen to generate the keys.

## Resolution


First of all make sure all the pre-requisites are met:

<b>1. Verify with your SFTP provider the type of key it is supported</b>
 a. SSH-1 vs SSH-2
 b. Generated key size in bits: default is 2048

<b>2. Authorise AEP IPs on your SFTP Provider</b>
 a. Verify the data center where your AEP instance is deployed
 i. VA7: North America
 ii. NLD2: Europe
 iii. AUS5: Australia
 b. AEP IPs can be found in the SFTP Connector documentation: See [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/cloud-storage/sftp.html](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/cloud-storage/sftp.html)

<b>3. AEP requires a OpenSSH base64 encoded private key </b>



If you are still having problems, there may be an issue with the way the private key generated by PuttyGen is transformed.

Note that AEP requires the private key to be of OpenSSL format encoded base64. Once the keys are generated, you must save the private key using the (PuttyGen) menu 'conversions'  'Export OpenSSH Key', this will generate the private key in OpenSSH format and <u>ONLY THEN</u> you can encode it in base64

AEP requires the private key to be base64 encoded, you can either:

• Use tool such as [https://www.base64encode.org/](https://www.base64encode.org/)

or

• Use OpenSSL by issuing the following command:

*openSSL base64 -in yourPrivateKeyFile -out
<br>yourPrivateKeyFileBase64*
