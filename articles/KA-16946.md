# ACC || user preventing the WF to run

## Description


One of my client has the workflows that generate the report has stopped because they disabled a user that's left the company. Upon disabling the user from the campaign classic in access management, the WF still throws an error. They tried to enabled the user back and they now running the workflow. But why did it stop when I disabled the user? And how do I get it to keep on working once disabling him?

 Can someone please suggest if there is any other way to removing the user so that client can use the WF.





Solution --

Whenever you face this error,

1. Open the workflow.
2. Click on Edit  Edit XML source …
3. Search for keyword <b>login=”</b>
4. You will find an element in the XML as shown here![](assets/dee6636f-799e-eb11-b1ac-000d3a368466.png)
5. In your case login will be having some value<b>.</b>
6. Empty the login attribute to make is <b>login=””</b>
7. Click on Ok to close the popup window.
8. Save the workflow.
9. Restart the workflow. If the workflow is part of a Campaign (which will be the case in 99% of cases), ask the relevant user on customer side to restart this workflow using their ID, from inside the Campaign and not from Workflow folder.
10. It should be fixed now.
11. Later you can go to Workflows View folder and search <b>*mdata contains login=”username”</b>* to search for other such workflows which might be impacted.
12. Repeat the above steps for each one.


Hope this helps.
