# How to migrate from the legacy binary protocol to HTTP/2-based APNs provider API

## Description


The Apple Push Notification service (APNs) will no longer support the legacy binary protocol as of March 31, 2021. [Read more](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=c88acm2b).
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Overview<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
Adobe Campaign Classic supports two Apple Push Notification service (APNs) protocols:

- <b>legacy binary</b> protocol, which is the default protocol for all Campaign Classic versions.
- <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol, which is already available, and is the new default protocol in the following releases: 
    - Campaign Classic 21.1 release. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/gs-release/gold-standard.html)
    - Campaign 20.2.4 release. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/previous-releases/release--20-2.html?lang=en#release-notes)
    - Campaign 19.1.8 release. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/previous-releases/release--19-1.html?lang=en#release-19-1-8-build-9039)

<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
If you send push notifications with the legacy Apple binary protocol, you need to <b>upgrade to one of the releases below</b>, or update to the HTTP/2-based APNs provider API.

Steps to update to <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol are detailed below.


## Resolution

<br><br>Check your version<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
Check your [Campaign Classic build number](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/starting-with-adobe-campaign/launching-adobe-campaign.html#getting-your-campaign-version) on all your instances: Marketing server, Execution server, Mid-sourcing server.

If the build number is inferior strictly to <b>8766</b>, your Campaign version does not support <b>HTTP/2</b>  protocol and needs to be upgraded to a newer version. [Learn how to upgrade](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-build-upgrade.html).

If the build number is <b>8766</b> or later,  your Campaign version supports HTTP/2 protocol. You need to update your configuration to switch to <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol.

- As a hosted or hybrid customer, you need to [reach out to Adobe Customer Care team](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/customer-one/using/home.html) to plan this upgrade.
- As an on-premise customer, you need to update your configuration as described in this article.

<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Update your configuration<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
To migrate to HTTP/2 protocol, update the [External account](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/external-accounts.html) used to perform your iOs deliveries of <b>all your instances</b> (Marketing, Execution, Mid-sourcing), as described below:

- Log into the instance as <b>Administrator</b>.


- Open the <b>External account</b> [used to perform iOS deliveries](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application.html).  To identify this external account, make sure the  <b>channel</b> parameter is set to <b>iOS channel</b> and the <b>Enabled</b> option is checked, as below:

- Click on the <b>Connector</b> tab, and set the value of <b>Access URL of the connector</b> to:
<br> <br>

    | `http://localhost:8080/nms/jsp/iosHTTP2.jsp` |

- Restart the <b>nlserver6</b> service of your server hosting Campaign Classic.
