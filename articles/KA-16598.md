# Livestream: Intermittent 503 and 409 errors

## Description


Livestream APIs may return 503 and/or 409 errors sometimes. The reason for these errors are described in the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/live-stream-api/troubleshooting.md), This can happen even maxConnections have been specified (409) and have regular flow of hits in the report suites (503).


## Resolution


This could be mainly due to the Livestream client connecting/disconnecting repeatedly. This type of client behavior will result in a myriad of issues, as both the load balancer and API endpoints cannot determine whether the client has lost its connection temporarily or if it's permanent. Per our documentation, the client should establish a connection and then continue to read from the stream without disconnecting. If the connection is lost, the client should wait ~60 seconds (to allow the load balancer and API to recognize the severed connection) and then attempt to re-establish the connection to the API.
