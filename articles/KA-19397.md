## Resolution


<b><u>Objective:</u></b> To upgrade the build

<b><u>Environment:</u></b> All

<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  'con' is a reserved keyword in Windows

<b><u>Resolution:</u></b>

In Microsoft Windows, you can not create folders or have extensions with the below words.

CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.

These are reserved keywords in Windows. Hence, naming an instance with these names will give you an error while upgrading as a folder with an instance name is created in your system.
